# OpenGL Game Project
This is just a little project to get me back into the swing of using C++ and
OpenGL. I hope that this project will teach me enough about graphics programming
to satisfy my curiosity.

## Instructions to build.
You will need on your system:
- cmake build pipeline
And the following build dependancies.
- SDL2
- SDL2_image
- OpenGL (Probaly already on your system)
- GLEW
- GLM
- ASSIMP (version 5.1 or higher)
